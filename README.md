# Lab 1: Variables and Functions - JavaScript

## Description

In this lab, we create JavaScript functions to manipulate strings, perform calculations, and handle conditional logic. The tasks include formatting names, calculating costs, checking eligibility, and applying discounts.

## Features

1. **`formatFullName(firstName, lastName)`**  
   Returns `LastName, FirstName` with proper capitalization. Returns `"Invalid name input."` if a name is missing.

2. **`calculateTotalCost(price, quantity, taxRate)`**  
   Calculates total cost with tax. Returns `"Invalid input."` if parameters are invalid.

3. **`checkEligibility(age, isEmployed)`**  
   Returns eligibility status based on age and employment.

4. **`calculateTotalCostWithDiscount(price, quantity, taxRate, discount = 0)`**  
   Refactored version to apply an optional discount before tax.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
